I'm building an AI content generator for SEO content/webpages.

I will use the following APIs: SERPER, Firecrawl, Gemini, OpenAI.

High level overview: 

User enters keyword + GEO for the keyword that the article is aimed towards 

SERPER returns top 10 results for that Keyword+GEO combination. These 
results are scraped with Firecrawl (to markdown, maincontent only). Based 
on this, an LLM creates a proposal for a structure/outline/list of 
headers. User can edit this, either by removing headers, rewriting them, 
etc. manually Add Headings or use the Generate Outline feature. If left 
blank, the AI generates a structure automatically. This ensures the 
article follows a logical flow that covers all necessary sub-topics for 
search engines.

Target Country: Crucial for SEO, as it ensures the AI uses local spelling (e.g., "color" vs. "colour") and references region-specific data or brands.

Tone of Voice & Point of View: Allows you to set a brand voice (e.g., "authoritative," "witty") and choose between First Person ("I"), Second Person ("You"), or Third Person perspectives.

Formality: Controls the level of professional language used.

This is one of the tool's most powerful sections. It defines where the AI gets its facts:

Connect to Web: A Deep Research tool is called to make an investigation into the subject. 

Knowledge Base: Allows you to upload your own assets (PDFs, docs) so the AI writes specifically about your proprietary info or brand details.

No search: No tools are used here.

Readability & Engagement (Formatting & Structure)
These settings focus on user experience (UX) and keeping readers on the page:

Formatting: Toggles for Bold keywords, Italics, Tables, Quotes, and Lists. These features make the text "scannable," which is a key ranking factor for Google.

Structure:

Call-To-Action (CTA): Automatically inserts a link and a closing pitch to drive conversions.

Key Takeaways: Adds a summary box at the start for "TL;DR" readers.

FAQs: Generates a list of questions common to the topic, which helps in ranking for "People Also Ask" snippets.

Article Size: Controls the depth of the article (e.g., 5–8 headings).

Internal Linking: This allows you to provide a Sitemap URL. The AI crawls your site to find existing articles and automatically inserts links to them within the new draft using natural anchor text.

Link Balance: A slider allows you to prioritize whether you want more internal links (to keep users on your site) or external links (to cite authoritative sources).


Ideas: ensemble approach. One LLM for each section header. Then a editor LLM that reads it through.
